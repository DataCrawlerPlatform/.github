# Hi there 👋 and Welcome
Welcome to the Data Crawler Git Hub organization.

# What Are We Trying to Accomplish
Data crawling is about enabling a simple, consistent capability to connect to various types of unique data soures with a variety of unique data types and enable a customized transformation experience for customers based on specific business needs. Data crawling is intended to provide businesses an opportunity to access meaningful information from data that is siloed away, unknown, undefined or worse forgotten about. Critical to address business needs is the ability to take data and turn it into meaningful and usable information. Our intent is to build and foster a community focused around addressing these business needs and building a comprehensive toolset to enable organizations to connect to, process, tag and deliver advanced insights including AI capabilities around data.


This project started in another community and we striggled within the constraints of that community.
